# Mood Board App - Background Removal Guide

## üéØ Current Features

### Background Removal Options
The app now includes three background removal algorithms you can choose from:

1. **Client-side (Default)** - Fast, runs in your browser, good for simple backgrounds
2. **AI (requires backend)** - Professional quality using rembg Python library
3. **GrabCut** - Advanced client-side algorithm with edge detection

### How to Use

#### Quick Start (Client-side Background Removal)
1. Open the app at http://localhost:3000
2. Upload images using the "Choose Images" button
3. The **BG Removal** dropdown in the top bar is set to "Client-side" by default
4. Click the background removal button (filter icon) on any image
5. Toggle between original/processed versions using the rotate icon

#### Advanced Setup (AI Background Removal)
For professional-quality AI background removal:

1. **Start the Python Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd python-backend
   ./start_backend.sh
   ```
   This will install dependencies and start the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000

2. **In the Web App:**
   - Change the **BG Removal** dropdown from "Client-side" to "AI (requires backend)"
   - Now background removal will use the professional rembg AI models

### UI Controls

- **BG Removal Dropdown**: Located in the top header, select your preferred algorithm
- **Individual Image Processing**: Click the filter icon on each image card
- **Batch Processing**: Select multiple images and use "Remove BG" button for bulk processing
- **Toggle Views**: Use the rotate icon to switch between original and processed versions

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js for the frontend
- Python 3.8+ (only needed for AI background removal)

### Running the Application

#### 1. Start the Next.js Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The app will run on http://localhost:3000*

#### 2. Optional - Start AI Backend (for better quality):
```bash
cd python-backend
./start_backend.sh
```
*The API server will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000*

## üîß Technical Details

### Client-side Algorithm
- Color-based background detection
- Edge preservation using Sobel operators
- Multiple background sampling points
- Gradual transparency for smooth edges

### AI Algorithm (when backend is running)
- Uses professional rembg Python library
- Multiple AI models available (u2net, u2net_human_seg, etc.)
- Significantly better quality than client-side processing
- Automatic fallback to client-side if API fails

### Features
- **Real-time processing feedback** with loading indicators
- **Intelligent algorithm selection** based on availability
- **Batch processing** for multiple images
- **Toggle functionality** to compare before/after results
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

#### 2. Start the Next.js frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000*

## üé® How to Use

4. **Monitor progress** as each image is processed

### Composition Mode:
1. **Click "Composition Mode"** for advanced layout work
2. **Layer controls are always visible** on the right side
3. **Drag images** from library to canvas
4. **Use layer controls** for precise positioning, sizing, rotation, and opacity
5. **Professional layer management** with drag-and-drop reordering

## üîß Technical Architecture
